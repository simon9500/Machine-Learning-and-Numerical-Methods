This directory contains work done on a weather classification problem and includes a report containing results.

`Weather.py` and `FeatureExtract.py` were both provided for the classification task.  `FeatureExtract.py` extracts the data from `basic.txt` or `advanced.txt` on the features you want and puts it in `mldata.p`.  `Weather.py` is a class providing functionality for manipulating the weather data.

`MachineLearning.py` is my attempt at classifying the weather data.
